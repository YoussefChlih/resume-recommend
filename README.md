## How to Edit This Code (You're in Control!)

Here's how you can bring your vision to life and customize this project:

**Option 1: Your Favorite IDE (For Developers)**

Develop locally and leverage the power of your preferred IDE.

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
    ```sh
    cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>
    ```
3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```sh
    npm i
    ```
4.  **Start the Development Server:** This will launch a local server with hot-reloading, so you can see your changes as you code.
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
    (Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed. [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating) is a great way to manage Node.js versions). Commit and push your changes to update the project.

**Option 2: Quick Edits Directly in GitHub**

*   Navigate to the file you want to modify.
*   Click the "Edit" (pencil) icon.
*   Make your changes and commit them.

**Option 3: GitHub Codespaces (Cloud IDE)**

*   Go to the main repository page.
*   Click the green "Code" button.
*   Select the "Codespaces" tab.
*   Create a new Codespace. This will launch a full VS Code environment in your browser, pre-configured for this project.
*   Edit, commit, and push your changes as you would in a local IDE.
